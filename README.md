# Crushing JavaScript Bugs
There are two bugs in the in-class build files:
1. You can drop more than one puzzle piece into a drop zone - there should only be one puzzle piece at a time.
2. The pieces donâ€™t restart and stay in the drop zones when you change the puzzle.
This is the improved version :)
